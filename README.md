# understood_code

This repository is a collection of technical tasks where I’ve committed to deeply understanding and documenting every line of code I write — as if I were explaining it to a curious beginner.

## Why this repo?

When I started working on real-world tasks (especially during my Summer 2025 internship), I often relied on AI tools to meet deadlines. While this helped me move fast, I realized I couldn’t always explain my own code — and that didn’t sit right with me.

I wanted to change that.

So I began taking a more deliberate approach:  
- Looking up every library and function even known ones to reinforce my understanding  
- Understanding how and *why* each line works  
- Experimenting with variations to see what breaks  
- Writing comments that could teach a beginner — or future me

## What this is

Each file in this repo is a working script or project where:
- Every line is clearly explained  
- Concepts are broken down, not glossed over  
- Side notes and experiments are often included

This isn’t just about writing code — it’s about building **real clarity**.

## Why share this?

This repo reflects a shift in how I learn:  
Not just finishing tasks — but understanding them deeply.  
Not just using AI — but learning *with* it.  
Not just solving — but thinking.

I’ll keep adding more files as I take on new tasks — from internships, open source, coursework, and self-driven learning.
